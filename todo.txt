TO DO
-----------------------------
	short term
	-------------------------
	added:
	- google image search (?gi)
	- added lists and standard to tray menu for uncompiled scripts
	
	open:
	- error line 135 with run missing a parameter :?
	- add keywords for searches: "::mp3 rhapsody" would list all mp3/wma/wav/au3/ogg/etc files with rhapsody in them, nothing else and irregardless of filter list, if a keyword is in a list, that list will be used!
	- keywords: :mp3, :doc, :xls, :jpg etc, but only for that extension, irregardless of filter lists 
	- change plugins to get their configurations from the custom file(s)
	- plugin: recycle bin emptier
	- when the user scrolled to the right in the listview, the place is remembered until a reload... change it so it's cleared on "empty" ?
	- plugin_tester: icon and GUI to test plugins? < change plugin_tester, it won't work with settimers
	- plugin gets loaded twice?
	- use senddata() to put plugin menu into the main script (http://www.autohotkey.com/community/viewtopic.php?t=83276)
	- instead of plugin tray menu, a context menu?
	- split hardcoded text into language vars
	- create language files
		* add "change language" subroutine to menu > just reload seems easiest because of gui and menu's
	- plugin: timer
	- replace all runs with shellrun? < problems with the menu and "run, explore " and "run, properties " options
	
	- optimise search so it refines old search results instead of searching anew for every character typed: Fragman: if(InStr(NewQuery, OldQuery))
	- check password encryption against http://throwingfire.com/storing-passwords-securely/
	- check hotkeyit for ideas
		* password: StringCaseSense On
	
	- create About GUI
	- add "action" in GUI (instead of contextmenu) : see demo of nDroid: http://www.codenite.com/demo.html
	
	- roll-out option main GUI when always visible
	- resize gui
	- add plugin GUI (use names instead of numbers?)
	- optimise menu
	- add context menu option to add custom entries (add hotkey option and everything) > only run files, not sends (as those don't show up in the hitlist)
	- add context menu to add to ignore list
	- add context menu to remove from ignore list
	- add timestamp to history (so we can prune history entries that are > 30 days old)
	- use Self Script Updater and make a GUI with URLGet
	- find a way to hide the trayicon for the plugin tester, maybe get the text of the script and append the #notrayicon line?
	- plugin: hide/move by sliding
	- menu plugin entries
	- add "only search" option and items to GUI2
	- history is not working after you refine a search (search and then add letters to the search term)
	- add "stick to top" and "stick to bottom"
	- add "transparency" with slider, maybe with mouseover to 0 and off to like 120?
	- "defrag" won't find anything, but "*defrag" will.... maybe use *%command_search% ?
	- history hits do not always show up after switching extensions on when a result is showing
	- add resizing
	- positions and stuff based on username?
	- edit plugins (like sh_winpad) so the hotkeys can be configured in the custom files
	- add encryption: http://www.autohotkey.com/community/viewtopic.php?t=25346
	- add option: transparent when not active
	- do a search trim instead of a new search when the user types instead of backspaces
	- how does AHK handle double subs in includes? require A_ScriptName in the subs?
	- splash screen while loading
	- optimize first run screen
	- check for missing files, offer to download and unzip, else exitapp
	- how to execute starting files in an included file
	- plugins dependable on portable (in scriptdir or in user data)
	- auto-update
	- check for apps\Everything.db < especially firstrun
	- check for hotkeys that are only one key or one modifier and alert the user
	- check for double hotkeys
	- add "runasadmin" to custom files
	- always run as admin
	- always run custom files as admin
	- hotkeys for filters / advanced/simple / commandsearch, etc
	- tips (like: use extension filter or hide folders to speed up the program)
	- split the extension filters into: - documents (doc*, xls*, txt, rtf, odf, pdf) - configuration (cfg, ini) - images (jpg, tiff, png, bmp, gif) - media (mp3, mp4, flac, ogg) - custom (lnk)
	- refine tray menu
	- refine preferences menu
	- add dragging of files out of the hitlist to copy
	- allow resizing of the main GUI
	- allow to select more than one hit (to delete or copy or whatever), NOTE: requires statusbar update
	- adjust the logging, too much is logged right now, what is needed for troubleshooting?
		~ existence of necessary files
		~ operations (command_search, searching for updates, what else?)

	
	long term
	-------------------------
	- allow for interactive debugging though DBGP
	- filter system/hidden files < FileGetAttrib, Attributes, C:\My File.txt does not seem to see hiberfil.sys as S or even H... problem there
	- allow custom_files to be edited inside the GUI_preferences
	- optimize parse_custom by using an array instead of a parsing loop?
	- optimize findstr usage (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490907.aspx)
	- make an installer
	- edit all text into variables / make language files possible
	- add RegEx support
	- add different options in the search editbox (like search on Google or do calculations)
	- adding programs to open files with certain extensions with (regardless of the system settings)
	- Use FileOpen() instead of FileRead?
	- add log file to preferences (parse the log and show it in a separate treeview, a la Spent)
	- add a check for the size of the log file
	- uninstall
