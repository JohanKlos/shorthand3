; in this file you can specify lines to start certain programs with a custom name or hotkey
; the correct syntax is:

; name|path or contents|hotkey|choice
; - name can be anything
; - contents is applicable when with choice "send" or "password" is chosen
; - hotkey is the hotkey that will execute the path or contents, using CTRL, ALT, SHIFT, SPACE, and any letters or numbers
; - choice can be either send, run, password

; example:
; np|C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe|WIN+N|run

; In the Preferences (section "Custom") you can Add and remove files similar to this one.
; I'd suggest making a separate one for your passwords, should you choose to use this tool to deploy them.
